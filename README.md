# gammaSPC
EPICS driver for Gamma Vacuum SPC/SPCe Ion Pump Controllers

Things are generically named SPCe, referring to the Ethernet model.  For 
RS232 support, use the spce_ser.proto file instead.  Everything else 
should be the same.

Submit pull requests for any fixes or added features (ex. GUIs for CSS, 
qt, etc).
